## Features
- **Automatic room creation system** allows players to join a game without complex settings.
- **5-player rooms**: Each room accommodates a maximum of 5 players.
- **Host system**: The first player to enter the room becomes the **host** and has the authority to start the game.
- **Real-time data transmission** enables players to control their vehicles from their local clients.
- **Competitive gameplay**: Players strive to **reach the finish line as quickly as possible**.

## How to Play?
1. Upon entering the game, a **room is automatically created** or the player joins an existing one.
