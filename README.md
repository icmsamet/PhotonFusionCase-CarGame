# PhotonFusionCase-CarGame

This case was developed over 1.5 days, leveraging my previous knowledge of Photon PUN and working with Unity 6 and Photon Fusion 2. 
It showcases the core mechanics of a multiplayer car racing game, utilizing Photon Fusion 2 for smooth online gameplay. 
The goal is to create a foundation for further feature additions and gameplay improvements in the future.

## Features
- **Automatic room creation system** allows players to join a game without complex settings.

- **Competitive gameplay**: Players strive to **reach the finish line as quickly as possible**.

## How to Play?
